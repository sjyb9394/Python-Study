1. Data Types
- Integers: Positive, Negative, 0
- Real Numbers: Positive, Negative decimal numbers => Use floating point
  - Can use e or E for exponent 
  ex) a = 75e9 => 75000000000
      b = 3954e-3 => 3.954
  - Computer has limit to show the floating numbers because computer use binary numbers for all operations
    -> When adding 0.3 and 0.6, the result should be 0.9, however, there is no way to show 0.9 in binary, therefore the result will be 0.899999999999... => Need to round up to show it correctly.
- Use +, -, *, /, // for arithmetic operation.
