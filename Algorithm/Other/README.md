Disjoint Set
- Union Find data structure
- A data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.

Spanning Tree
- A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. 

Kruskal Algorithm
- finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph

Topology Algorithm
- Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering

Prime Number
- The Sieve of Eratosthenes

Tow Pointer
- The two pointer technique is a useful tool to utilize when searching for pairs in a sorted array

Permutation
